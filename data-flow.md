## Independent Paths

### Simple Paths

> _A simple path is a path in which all nodes, except possibly the first and the last, are distinct._

### Loop-Free Paths

> _A loop-free path is a path in which **all** nodes are distinct._

## `def()`, `c-use()`

| Nodes i | def(i) | c-use(i) |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |


## `p-use()`

| Edges (i, j) | predicate(i, j) | p-use(i, j) |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
